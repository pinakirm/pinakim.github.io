I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Purdue University, advised by <a href="https://rjvak7.github.io/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dr. Rajiv Khanna</a>.</p> <p>My research focuses on bridging theoretical foundations of machine learning with practical challenges. Previosuly, I have worked on discrete MCMC sampling, under probabilistic methods for machine learning. I am also focussed on data-centric AI, particularly ML-enabled data annotation, data quality estimation, and data usage to better engage with the data pipeline to improve model genralization. Lately, Iâ€™ve been exploring how these rigorous, theory-driven principles can be applied to LLMs to better understand and improve their behavior.</p> <p>In Summer 2023, I completed my M.S. in Computer Science and Statistics (Joint MS with Thesis) at Purdue, where my research centered on studying contextual bandits under sub-region-based disagreement for active learning. Prior to that, I received my B.S. in Computer Science from Purdue in Spring 2021, focusing on machine learning, theoretical computer science, and databases, with minors in Mathematics and Statistics.</p> </body></html>
