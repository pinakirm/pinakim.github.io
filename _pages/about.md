Hi, I am Pinaki! I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Purdue University, advised by [Dr. Rajiv Khanna](https://rjvak7.github.io/). 

My research focuses on bridging theoretical foundations of machine learning with practical challenges. Previosuly, I have worked on discrete MCMC sampling, under probabilistic methods for machine learning. I am also focussed on data-centric AI, particularly ML-enabled data annotation, data quality estimation, and data usage to better engage with the data pipeline to improve model genralization. Lately, I’ve been exploring how these rigorous, theory-driven principles can be applied to LLMs to better understand and improve their behavior.

In Summer 2023, I completed my M.S. in Computer Science and Statistics (Joint MS with Thesis) at Purdue, where my research centered on studying contextual bandits under sub-region-based disagreement for active learning. Prior to that, I received my B.S. in Computer Science from Purdue in Spring 2021, focusing on machine learning, theoretical computer science, and databases, with minors in Mathematics and Statistics.

If you’re another researcher, outside Purdue, in machine learning, sampling algorithms, or healthcare+ai( a field I am deeply passionate about!), please feel free to shoot to email me. I welcome conversations about potential research collaborations and ways my expertise might be helpful.
For current Purdue students interested in working with me, please email me to set up a one-off coffee chat if you’d like to discuss some research ideas.
