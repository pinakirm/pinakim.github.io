Hi, I am Pinaki! I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Purdue University, advised by [Dr. Rajiv Khanna](https://rjvak7.github.io/). 

My research focuses on bridging statistical foundations of machine learning with practical challenges. I deeply care about data-centric AI, particularly ML-enabled data annotation, data quality estimation, and data usage. I am also interested in probabilistic inference under discrete MCMC Sampling. Lately, I’ve been exploring how these rigorous, theory-driven principles can be applied to LLMs to better understand and improve their behavior.

In Summer 2023, I completed my M.S. in Computer Science and Statistics at Purdue, where my thesis centered on studying contextual bandits under sub-region-based disagreement for active learning. Prior to that, I received my B.S. in Computer Science from Purdue in Spring 2021, specializing in machine learning, theoretical computer science, and databases & information systems, with minors in Mathematics and Statistics.

If you’re another researcher, outside Purdue, working in machine learning, sampling algorithms , or healthcare+ai( a field I am deeply passionate about!), please feel free to email me. I welcome conversations about potential research collaborations and ways my expertise might be helpful. For current Purdue students interested in working with me, please email me to set up a one-off coffee chat if you’d like to discuss some research ideas.
